# datviewer
Python script for viewing and outputting the contents of the resume.dat

Need to have Python 3 installed as well as pip install bencoder 0.2.0

I don't recall if I have the code for the fastresume working so test that at your leisure.

To use:

Execute the script
Enter 1 for resume.dat
Enter the path of your file
Let it run

The output will be seperated by commas which you can copy and paste to csv 

You'll get the following:

Name of file
Date added on
Date completed on
Amount downloaded
Amount uploaded
Path of file
Time seeded

Time is set to convert from epoch to EST, please adjust accordingly for your timezone.
